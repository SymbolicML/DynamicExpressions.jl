The operators enum contains all of the operators used. Unlike eval_tree_array with the normal OperatorEnum, the array cX is sliced only along the first dimension. i.e., if cX is a vector, then the output of a feature node will be a scalar. If cX is a 3D tensor, then the output of a feature node will be a 2D tensor.
